// Loops :
// A lot of times we have to do things repreatedly.

// Using loops we will be able to repeat a task again and again.


// Q) Write a program to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);
console.log(4);
console.log(5);
console.log(6);
console.log(7);
console.log(8);
console.log(9);
console.log(10);
// 10 times we have to write console.log() with different values.


// What is the element of repeatition?
// Printing a number and then moving to the next number.  


// How to stop this infinite running instructions?
// In the previous question, the moment i becomes greater than 10, we want
// to stop it. So, technically we have to take a decision.
