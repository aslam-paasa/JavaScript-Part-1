// We were already executing some piece of code/instruction (making a tea).
// For that we do some static things like -
// (1) take a pan, 
// (2) put the pan on gas, 
// (3) turn on the gas, 
// (4) put the milk, 
// (5) wait for the milk to boil.
// Note : If we are going to make a tea then this part is going to be same, and
// if we want to make a coffee then this part is also same.

// Once milk is boiled we are going to take a decision that 
// "Do we want to make tea?" (condition)
// "Yes" : "No"
// If "yes" then "Put tea leaves" and "No" then I want to make coffee "Put Coffee Powder"
