/* How do we prepare this blue print?
 - In JavaScript we have a "class" keyword.
 - Using the class keyword we can prepare blue-print. 
 -  Syntax : 
            class <class_name> { 
                // define properties
                // defined behaviors
            }
 - Then using this blue-print we can create real-life entities.
 - In order to create real-life entities and manage them, we have two
   new keywords -
        (a) new
        (b) this
 - So, these 3 keywords together ("class", "new", "this") form most of
   the basis of how we write Object-Oriented Code in JavaScript.

Note : "class" keyword is not always available in JS.
       Old JS Code base contains Function based Code.*/
