/* The main difference between with Array and Without Array are -
1. Without array each value are stored in different variables which result
   in different memory location, whereas using array the values are stored
   in contiguous memory allocation.
2. For developer we can easily maintain code and data manipulation is good
   for larger data, without array we need to create 100 variables for
   100 values but in array we can insert the values in the single array.
   
Note :
1. When we have to create a database with complex and multiple variables
   to store, it will be difficult to control a database without using an
   array.
2. Using Arrays in the database makes it easier to manage and control the
   database in the programming language; we can easily create an array
   and enter or remove values in it.*/
