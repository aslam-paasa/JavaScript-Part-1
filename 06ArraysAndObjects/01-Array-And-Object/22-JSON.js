/* When we deal with realife JSON it is in the form of big files containing
   thousands of lines of data and data is going to be in this form -
   { name: 'abc', rno: 10, phno: 987 }
 - Data Analysts get data in this form and from this they have to write down
   some code so that they can put all this data to excel file. And when
   we have data in excel file, it is way more accessible and on that we
   can also perform some mathematical operations.*/
