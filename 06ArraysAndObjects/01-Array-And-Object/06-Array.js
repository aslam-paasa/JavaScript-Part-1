/*What are the types of Array?
- Array can be divided into two types of Arrays :
 1. Single Dimension Arrays (We have discussed above)
 2. Multi-Dimensional Arrays - 
    (a) 2-D Arrays
    (b) 3-D Arrays
    (c) Jagged Arrays
    
Q) When we have single dimensional array, why these arrays came into the
   picture?
-> We use multi-dimensional arrays because with every dimension we can 
   provide different set of values.
-> Note :
        (a) 1-D Array   | (Coding Questions as well as Theory Questions 
        (b) 2-D Array   |  came from these two)
        (c) Jagged Array| (Theory Questions) 

1. Array with Single Dimension :
 - We can declare and allocate memory for an array in a single statement
   in JavaScript.
 - Here is an example -
    
    // To create a Single Dimensionl Array :
    var colors = ["Blue", "Green", "Yellow"];
    // To print the elements in the console :
    console.log(colors);
    ["red", "blue", "green"];

 - Different approach to create array in JavaScript:
    // To create an Single-Dimension array:
    const myArray = [ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l' , 'o' );
    // first element
    console.log(myArray[0]); // to print "h"
    // second element
    console.log(myArray[1]); // to print "e"
    // third element
    console.log(myArray[2]); // to print "l"
    // fourth element
    console.log(myArray[3]); // to print "l"
    // fifth element
    console.log (myArray[4]); // to print "o"
    
    Output:
        "h"
        "e"
        "l"
        "l"
        "o"
