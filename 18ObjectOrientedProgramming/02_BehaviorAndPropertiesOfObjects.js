/*
 - If we see two real-life entities - IPhone, Macbook, then the properties
   of two reallife entities will be different (data) but their behavior is 
   going to same (activity). That we can actually display a product, buy
   a product but the properties of the product will be different.
 - "Properties of an object helps us to uniquely identify two objects but
   behavior is same."
 - These properties are called as "data-members" -
    (a) name
    (b) price
    (c) rating
    (d) description
 - And the behaviors are called as "Member-functions" -
    (a) Buy a product
    (b) Wishlist
    (c) Add to Cart
