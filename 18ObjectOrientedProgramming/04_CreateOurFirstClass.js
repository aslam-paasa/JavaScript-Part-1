/* Let's Create our First Class : 
 - Now let' say we want to create one "Product" class. So we will use the
   class keyword with class_name + curly braces.
 - Inside the class we can mention a bunch of properties 
 - We just need to mention the name of the properties, we don't need to
   mention let/var/const.
 - And we can have some behaviors (functions)
 - Here, if we want to write a function we no need to mention "function"
   keyword
 - So, this is kind of a boiler-plate that we can actually get started 
   with and this is how actually we create a class.
