/* Relational Operators :
 - These are more or less done for comparison. 
 - <, >, <=, >=
 - Relational Operators take two operands and they might be having some
   symbol, based on the value they take the first value and compare it
   with the second value.
   
   Operand1  >  operand2
             <
             >=
             <=
             
 - JS gives us true/false based on these statements.*/
