/*
Callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
Callback functions are used when there is an asynchronous process.

-> Js is synchronous single-threaded languages and it can do just one thing at a time.
-> It has one callstack and it can execute just thing at a time.
-> Whatever code we give to javascript will be quickly executed by JS Engine*/ 

console.log("Namaste");

// If we want to execute this code after 5 seconds
// We can wrap it inside a callback function and pass it to setTimeout
setTimeout(function () {
    console.log("javaScript");
}, 5000);    
// Now it is the job of the setTimeout to set this callback function after 5 seconds
// And this is how callback plays an important role in writing asynchronous code in JS

console.log("Season 2");
