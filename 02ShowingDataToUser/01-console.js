/*Console Object Methods :
  => In this section, we will cover about console and console object methods. 
Absolute beginners usually do not know which to use: console.log(), document.write() or document.getElementById.

-> We use console object methods to show output on the browser console and we use document.write to show output on the browser document(view port). Both methods used only for testing and debugging purposes. The console method is the most popular testing and debugging tool on the browser. We use document.getElementById() when we like to interact with DOM try using JavaScript. We will cover DOM in another section.
-> In addition to the famous, console.log() method, the console provides other more methods.
