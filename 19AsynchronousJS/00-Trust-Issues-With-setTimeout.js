// setTimeout has trust issues
// setTimeout with a delay of 5000ms doesn't always wait for 5 seconds
// setTimeout doesn't guarantee that callback method will be called exactly after
// 5 seconds. It might also takes 6 seconds or maybe even 10 seconds. It all
// depends on the callstack

// Q) Why this setTimeout has trust issues?
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(function cb() {
    console.log("Callback");
}, 5000);

console.log("End");

// When we run JS Code, Global Execution Context (GEC) is created and that is
// pushed inside the callstack.
// Now the code will run line-by-line :

// 1. First it will print "Start" in the console
// 2. Now the code moves onto setTimeout() function line. When we see the setTimeout
//    it actually registers this callback method "cb()" into Web API's environment
//    and it also starts a timer of 5000ms. Now the function() is waiting in the
//    Web API to finish the timer. 
// 3. But JS doesn't wait for anything. It just registers this setTimeout and moves
//    to the next line and now "end" is printed in the console.

// Suppose we had 1 million line of code after this "End" which takes a lot of time
// to run (10sec). In that case, the GEC will still be busy executing these millions
// of lines of code while the timer is running. So, this GEC will wait for 10sec
// and execute the lines.

// But our setTimeout() timer was running for 5 seconds. While this callstack/thread
// is busy executing millions of lines of code, this timer has already expired long
// back and callback function "cb()" is already pushed inside the "callback queue".
// And now "event loop" is constantly checking whether the callstack (GEC) is 
// empty or not. If the callstack is empty then only it can take this callback 
// queue method i.e. "cb()" and pushed inside the callstack. And that's how event
// loop works.

// But in this case GEC doesn't move out before 10 sec, and this setTimeout()

// After 10 seconds!. Though setTimeout() was for 5sec it will for this GEC to
// move out of the callstack. This is also known as "Concurrency Model" in JavaScript.
