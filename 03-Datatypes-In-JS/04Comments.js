/* Comments :
 - Comments are a piece of code that is for documentation purpose.
 - The programming language will just avoid comments during execution.
 - Comments is of no use to programming language. we write it just for 
   the sake of better readability for the people who are going to read
   our code. For these people we are going to write our comment.
 - In JS, there are two ways to create comment -
   (a) Single line comment -> double forward slash //
   (b) Multi line comment  -> /* ... */

console.log("Hello world!");
// This is some random comment

console.log("Ending");  // this is a console statement
/*
  This is
  a multiline
  comment
*/ 

console.log("finally");
