Q) What are functions?
 - A function is a piece of code that performs a specific task and which can be
   reused.
 - Suppose you need to write a program to fund inf the sum of two numbers is
   greater than 10. You could write the following functions for it :
   
   (a) A function that adds two numbers
   (b) A function which checks if the number is greater than 10
   
 - Functions make our code more readable and reusable.*/
