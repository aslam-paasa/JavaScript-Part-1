// Let's assume that we are newly shifted to a city like Bangalore. We are setting
// up our home and we want to buy some groceries for our home.

// Way-1 : Traditional Approach
// Go to grocery Store
// Go to every section one by one and pick the grocery "manually" that we need.

// Way-2 : Online Grocery
// When we take a subscription (milk subscription)
// Every morning @9am, milk packet will be delivered to us.
// Now we don't know where that milk is coming from and we are not manually picking
// up that milk packet.
// Somewhere behind the scenes some tech operations, a lot of people are involved
// and get it directly
// We don't tell how to get it, we don' tell where to get it from, we just tell
// what do we want to get. And within 15 min we get at our doopstep. 

// A similar set of things happen in programming also. There are types of 
// programming languages : 
// (a) Imperative programming languages - C, C++, Java, etc
// (b) Declarative programming languages - SQL

// Imperative programming languages - C, C++, Java, etc. Here we mention what to
// do and how to do. We write a function like merge sort, we step by step tell the
// algorithm that these are the steps that we want to execute and that's how our
// corresponding algorithm is executed.

// Declarative programming languages - SQL. In SQL we don't tell that how to get
// data from table, we just tell what is the thing we want to have.

// Now even in imperative language like JavaScript, let's say there is an array
// arr=[1,2,3,4]
// If we want to access this collection, we will tell JS language, from the collection
// array go to memory location defined by the "index-2" and return me that data
// and that is "imperative programming". 
// But we can somehow implement our program/code so that at an in-depth inner level
// it still tehcnically "imperative" but when we are calling it, it looks like
// declarative. So, there are some coding patterns that we can use in order to make
// this data fetching look more "declarative" rather than "imperative", where we 
// will not mention which collection to get it from and how to get it from the
// collection. When we want the data we technically just call the collection.
